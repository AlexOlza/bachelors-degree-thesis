# bachelors-degree-thesis: Modelling Solar Evolution with MESA and EVtwin

"In this Bachelorâ€™s Degree Thesis, we will first work towards the derivation of the equa-
tions of stellar structure and evolution, and then we will dive into the most widely used
algorithm to solve them: The Henyey method.
After that, we will generate and evolve some solar models and study in detail some of
their structural properties. To achieve this we will make use of AMUSE- the Astrophys-
ical Multipurpose Software Environment developed by Simon Portegies Zwart and Steve
McMillan."
